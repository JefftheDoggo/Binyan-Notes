Use them to try and prove shit ig
Arcs/Segment Proofs Angle at the centre is the same as that at the circumference Angles in the same segment are equal Angles in a semicircle are 90˚ Tangent Proofs A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a line drawn from the centre to the point of contact 2 tangents drawn from an external point have the same length The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to any angle in the alternate segment Chord/Secant Proofs If AB and CD are 2 chords of a circle, intersecting at P $PA \times PB$ = $PC \times PD$ This still works if P is outside the circle If P is a point outside a circle and T, A, B are points on the circle such that PT is a tangent and PAB is a secant, then $|PT|^2 = |PA|{\times}|PB|$ Cyclic Quadrilateral Proofs A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180° degrees</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Matrices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Matrices/</guid><description>Matrix Rules A matrix is a table except it&amp;rsquo;s mathed</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Transformations-on-the-plane/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Transformations-on-the-plane/</guid><description>Bro not even I get this your on your own for this one.

Different contexts require different amounts of evidence as proof of truth.</description></item><item><title>Vectors</title><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Vectors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Spec/Vectors/</guid><description>[[#Representations of Vectors|Representations of Vectors]] [[#Adding and Subtracting Vectors|Adding and Subtracting Vectors]] [[#Vector Components|Vector Components]] [[#Calculating the Magnitude and Direction|Calculating the Magnitude and Direction]] [[Y11 Spec/Vectors#Extra stuff|Vectors]] [[#Position Vectors|Position Vectors]] [[#Scalar (Dot) Product|Scalar (Dot) Product]] Representations of Vectors Vectors have both Magnitude and Direction</description></item></channel></rss>
