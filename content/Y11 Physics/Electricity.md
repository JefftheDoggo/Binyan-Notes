## Charges
### Static Charge
- Charge is a **property of matter**
    - It does not have a strong definition
- An **object of charge** produces an **electric field** around it
    - Properties of the Electric Field:
        - Extends to infinity
        - Other objects of charge experience an electric force when in the field
        - Has an electric force which decreases with distance from the object
            - This force may be attractive or repulsive
- _Static charge_ refers to how the electric charge is not moving (Stationary)
### Charge States
- **2 Types of Charge**: positive and negative
    - Positive
        - e.g. protons, cations, α\alphaα, positrons
    - Negative
        - e.g. electrons, anions
    - The two types of charge behave oppositely
- **No charge/charges are balanced**: _Neutral_
    - It itself is not a type of charge
    - e.g. neutron, neutrinos, atoms, etc.


- Law of Charges: Opposites attract, Likes repel

### Electrical Charge Diagrams
- Charge is uniformly distributed around charged object
    - ∴\therefore∴ Field lines are evenly distributed around the object
- Rules:
    - **Minimum of 4** field lines
        - Don’t waste time with extra lines; minimise the amount you draw
        - Number of field lines indicate relative density for different objects
    - Must be an arrow going in correct direction
        - Outward for positive
        - Inward for negative
    - Lines must start/finish at the surface of the object
        - Lines should only touch the object, not pierce through
        - They should always come off the particle at **right angles** even if they will curve later
    - Should start/finish perpendicular to surface
### Interactions between charged objects
1. Positive - Negative
	- The electric field flows from the positive object to the negative object
2.  Like charges
	- The electric fields repel each other and leave **empty space** between the objects
3. Charged plates with opposite charges
	- The electric field flows from the positive charge plate to the negative charge plate
4. Charged plate and oppositely charge object
	- Electric field flows from positive object to negative plate (or vice versa)
## Transfer of Charge
- Friction will transfer e−e^-e− from one surface to another
    - A **surface** with **greater affinity** for e−e^-e− compared to a second surface, will **gain** e−e^-e− and vice versa
        - Electron affinity is linked with **electronegativity**
- We cannot tell whether an object has gained positive or negative charge
    - We don’t know which object gains/loses electrons
- _Charging by induction_ is where **electrons are redistributed** on an object to produce regions of different charge (i.e. an electric dipole)
    - The separation of charge is temporary and will reverse once the inducing charge is removed
    - This can be observed by using an electroscope
        - An _electroscope_ is a scientific tool that can detect an electric charge on a body
        - It is composed of a pair of metal leaves hanging off a vertical metal rod contained within an insulating box
- _Charging by conduction_ is when electrons are physically transferred causing loss/gain of charge
    - This loss/gain of charge is not temporary

## Coulomb's Law

- Electrostatically charged objects **exert a force** upon one another
    - We can calculate the magnitude of this force using **Coulomb’s Law**
- Coulomb’s Law: $F_e = \frac{k \times q_1 \times q_2}{r^2}$  
    - $F_e$ = the **electric force** acting between the two objects of charge
        - ​ $F_e$ is **a vector** (Force)→ either is an **attractive force** or a **repulsive force**
            - Two opposite charges → attractive force (towards each other)
            - Two like charges → repulsive force (away from each other)
    -  $k$ = **constant** of proportionality = $9.00 \times 10^9 N m^2 C^-2$ 
        - Measured in $N m^2  C^-2$ 
    - ​ $q_1$ and $q_2$= the charges on the two charged objects
        - Measured in coulombs (C)
    - r = radius/the **distance between** the two **objects**
