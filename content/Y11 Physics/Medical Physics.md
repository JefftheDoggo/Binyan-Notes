## Uses of Radioisotopes in Diagnostic Imaging:

A gamma camera or SPECT camera (fig.1) is a camera that detects flashing light (scintillons) produced by gamma rays interacting with a sodium iodide (NaI) crystal at the front of the camera. The gamma camera detects the energy from a radiotracer in your body and converts it into an image, it has radiation detectors called gamma camera heads.  A radiotracer is a radioactive tracer made from a  chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope. The gamma camera itself does not emit any radiation, only detects gamma radiation from the tracer

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans are a medical imaging procedure that provides unique information about how an organ or system in the body is working. PET scans are mainly used to assess cancers, neurological (brain) diseases and cardiovascular (heart-related) disease. It works by detecting where sugar is being used in the body. The sugar is injected into the body with some radioisotopes in it, and tracked through the body by detecting the radiation. Malignant tissues generally use more glucose, so this can be used to detect these tissues.

## Use of Radioisotopes in Therapeutic Treatments

Radioisotopes can be used to kill cancer cells. As the radioisotope begins to decay, it affects the targeted tissue or tumour because cancerous cells absorb more of the radioisotope than noncancerous cells do. The higher dose of radiation eventually destroys the cancer cells, but leaves the normal cells relatively intact.

One method of doing this is using the gamma knife. Gamma knife (fig.2) uses very precise beams of gamma rays to treat areas of disease. The very intense radiation makes it possible to treat internal issues without an incision, but radiosurgery is very risky can prevent cell growth.

## Production of Radioisotopes for Medicine

Medical radioisotopes are made from materials bombarded by neutrons in a reactor, or by protons in an accelerator called a cyclotron (fig.3), which uses electromagnets to accelerate particles to very high speeds. Different radioisotopes are used for different medical procedures, as they each have different properties depending on the mass, stability, and type of radiation.

The most commonly used radioisotope in medicine is technetium-99m, which is produced from uranium silicide which has been processed into molybdenum-99, which then undergoes beta decay to become technetium-99m.

Technetium-99m’s short half-life (6 hours) and weak gamma ray emission makes it ideal for imagin the body to detect disease, without causing too much damage to the body tissue.

## Proton Therapy

Proton therapy is a radiation treatment that uses beams of protons to destroy tumours. The properties of protons (their positive charge) make them effective at targeting tumours of different sizes and shapes.

As protons move through the body, they attract electrons, which have a negative charge. The proton travels at very high speeds at first (around 2/3 of the speed of light), so it has very little interactions, and very little radioactive activity at first. As it progress through the body, the proton slows down and interacts with many more electrons, causing much more radioactive activity. This point is known as the Bragg Peak (Fig.4).

By changing the energy of the proton when it is launched, we can change the depth the protons slow down at and where most of the radiation is released. Because the most interactions are at this point, proton therapy can accurately target specific areas of the body and not healthy tissues.

## Fast Neutron Therapy

Fast neutron therapy is used for specific diseases that are “radioresistant”, i.e. they are not easily removed by conventions forms of radiotherapy. Fast neutrons are variably reactive with different tissues, affecting cancerous tissue more than healthy tissue. This means a lethal dose for the diseased cells is not a lethal dose for other cells, meaning it can be used to treat disease.

## Radiation Dosimetry

Radiation dosimetry is the science by which radiation dose is determined by calculation or measurement. Radiation dosimetry is important, as different medical procedures require different levels of dosages of radiation, just like other medicines.

 Radiation Dose, or Absorbed Dose is the amount of radiation deposited in a tissue, divided by the mass of the tissue, and is measured in Grays (Gy). This measure is not the best way to measure radiation dose, as both the type of tissue and type of radiation will change the effect of the same radiation deposited.

To account for this, Dose Equivalent is used. It is calculated by the absorbed dose multiplied by the quality factor of a specific type of radiation (Fig.6). Dose Equivalent is measure in Sieverts (Sv).

|Radiation|Quality Factor|
|α particles|20|
|Neutrons|10|
|β particles|1|
|γ rays|1|
|X-rays|1|
