## Vectors
Vectors have magnitude and direction, scalars just have magnitude

Common vectors and scalars
| Vector             | Symbol  | Unit    | Scalar         | Symbol  | Unit  |
| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | -------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Displacement | s | m   | distance | s | m |
| Velocity           | v       | m/s     | Speed          | v       | m/s   |
| Acceleration       | a       | $m/s^2$ | temperature    | T       | ˚C\˚K |
| Force              | F       | N       | Time           | t       | s     |
| Jerk                   |   j      |   $m/s^3$      |     Work           |    W     |   J    |
## Vector Diagrams
Demonstrate all similar vectors in the system
Head-tail
	Resolved
Either draw a compass or refer to the direction
## Free Body Diagram
Refer to all the FORCES acting on the body
	Name 'special' forces (e.g. Gravity)
	To scale
	Not resolved
