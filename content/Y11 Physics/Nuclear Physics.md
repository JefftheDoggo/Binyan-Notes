## Decay
- When a radioisotope (A radioactive isotope (same element, different mass number (different neutrons))) undergoes radioactive decay, it will emit a high-energy particle or wave (radiation), there are several types of particles/waves emitted during radioactive decay:
	- Alpha Particles - $\alpha$ 
		- $^4_2\alpha \rightarrow$ Same as a Helium nucleus
		- Parent atom loses two protons and two neutrons during alpha decay
			- Atomic number decreases by 2, mass number decreases by 4
	- Beta Particles - $\beta$ 
		- $^0_{-1}\beta \rightarrow$ Same as an electron 
			- Parent atom turns a neutron into a proton an electron, and an antineutrino, emitting the electron
				- Atomic number increases by 1, mass number does not change
		- $^0_{1}\beta \rightarrow$ Same as a positron
			- Parent atom turns a proton into a neutron, positron and a neutrino (v)(v)(v) and the positron and neutrino are emitted
				- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number does not change
	- Gamma particles - $\gamma$
		- $^0_{0}\gamma \rightarrow$ is an electromagnetic wave with a very high frequency and small wavelength
			- Parent atom goes from an excited state to a base state
				- Actual atom is unchanged
## Nuclear Equations
Remember to balance it right or you'll get it wrong. Refer to the types of radiation to figure out what type happened.
## Properties of Radiation
## Half-Life
When a radioactive element decays, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time. The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life.

Use logic to do the math it's not too hard.
## Fission, Fusion, and Mass Defect
Mass defect is the difference between the actual mass of the nucleus and the predicted mass calculated by adding the mass of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.

This difference is because of the mass of the binding energy in the nucleus. Without the binding energy, the nucleus would not be stable, and would fall apart.

For an atom to be stable, it's mass must be less than that of its constituents.

E=mc2 is the relationship between the mass defect (m) and the amount of energy that it represents, by the factor of the speed of light squared.

Nuclei with a large binding energy per nucleon are most stable. Smaller nuclei will undergo fusion (2 become 1) to become more stable. Larger nuclei will undergo fission (1 become 2) to become more stable.
## Pros and Cons of Nuclear Power
- Cons:
	- Nuclear Weapons proliferation
		- Nuclear energy is very closely connected to Nuclear Weaponry. The Nuclear Weapon Non-Proliferation act was meant to spread nuclear energy without spreading nuclear weaponry, but 5 countries have used this program to create their own nuclear weapons. It is hard to tell the difference between a nuclear power station, and a site to build nuclear weapons. The road to nuclear energy is paved by nuclear power plants
	- Nuclear waste and pollution
		- Nuclear waste takes tens of thousands of years to stop being radioactive. It is very dangerous, it can't be used, and it is incredibly hard to dispose of.
	- Accidents and disasters
		- Since the development of nuclear energy, there have been 7 major disasters. 3 of these were contained, but 4 were not. These have caused many deaths, and the areas in which these disasters happen are then uninhabitable.

- Pros:
	- Nuclear energy saves lives
		- Nuclear energy has saved 15000 lives since it was developed. A study by NASA finds that nuclear energy has the smallest death per unit of energy rate of any form of energy, even when taking into account the deaths due to nuclear meltdowns.
	- Nuclear energy reduces CO2 emmissions
		- Since the 1960, 64 Giga-tonnes of CO2 have not emitted because we are using nuclear energy instead of fossil fuels.
	- New technologies
		- New technologies may solve problems relating to nuclear energy. Nuclear reactor technology hasn’t improved since the 1970s.
