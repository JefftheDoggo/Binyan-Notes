## Decay
- When a radioisotope (A radioactive isotope (same element, different mass number (different neutrons))) undergoes radioactive decay, it will emit a high-energy particle or wave (radiation), there are several types of particles/waves emitted during radioactive decay:
	- Alpha Particles - $\alpha$ 
		- $^4_2\alpha \rightarrow$ Same as a Helium nucleus
		- Parent atom loses two protons and two neutrons during alpha decay
			- Atomic number decreases by 2, mass number decreases by 4
	- Beta Particles - $\beta$ 
		- $^0_{-1}\beta \rightarrow$ Same as an electron 
			- Parent atom turns a neutron into a proton an electron, and an antineutrino, emitting the electron
				- Atomic number increases by 1, mass number does not change
		- $^0_{1}\beta \rightarrow$ Same as a positron
			- Parent atom turns a proton into a neutron, positron and a neutrino (v)(v)(v) and the positron and neutrino are emitted
				- Atomic number decreases by 1, mass number does not change
	- Gamma particles - $\gamma$
		- $^0_{0}\gamma \rightarrow$ is an electromagnetic wave with a very high frequency and small wavelength
			- Parent atom goes from an excited state to a base state
				- Actual atom is unchanged
## Nuclear Equations
Remember to balance it right or you'll get it wrong. Refer to the types of radiation to figure out what type happened.

## Half-Life
When a radioactive element decays, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time. The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life.

Use logic to do the math it's not too hard.
## Fission, Fusion, and Mass Defect
Mass defect is the difference between the actual mass of the nucleus and the predicted mass calculated by adding the mass of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.

This difference is because of the mass of the binding energy in the nucleus. Without the binding energy, the nucleus would not be stable, and would fall apart.

For an atom to be stable, it's mass must be less than that of its constituents.

E=mc2 is the relationship between the mass defect (m) and the amount of energy that it represents, by the factor of the speed of light squared.

Nuclei with a large binding energy per nucleon are most stable. Smaller nuclei will undergo fusion (2 become 1) to become more stable. Larger nuclei will undergo fission (1 become 2) to become more stable.
## Nuclear Power Stations

#### Fuel
- U-235 is fissile and is used. We used Uranium with 4% U-235 since enriching the fuel is difficult and expensive
- U-238 is not fissile, but is fertile as it can transmutate into Pu-239 which is fissile when it absorbs a fast neutron, which is produced by the fission of U-235.
- Pu-239 is produced from U-238 absorbing a neutron and produced a similar amount of energy to U-235 when is undergoes fission.

#### Issues with making nuclear power:
- Neutrons emitted by uranium-235 (fuel) are very fast but uranium-235 is most fissile when irradiated by **slow-moving neutrons**
    - The emitted neutrons need to be slowed down to continue an efficient chain reaction
- Uranium-235 fission emits an average of 2.47 neutrons which need to be controlled as **it could cause an explosion**
- The heat generated in the reactor from the fission needs to be collected for electricity generation
- Most Uranium is U-238, which is not fissile. For Uranium to be usable as a fuel, it needs to be enriched with U-235. This can be done using their slightly differing masses, but is very difficult and expensive.

#### Components of Nuclear Power Stations

- Fuel Rods
	- Fuel rods are long, thin rods the contain pellets of enriched uranium
	- Fuel rods use uranium with 4% uranium-235
		- The enriched uranium (in pellet form) is packed into a thin aluminium tube 3-5 metres long
	- A large nuclear reactor has over 1000 fuel rods in its core
		- Fuel rods need to be replaced around every 4 years

- Moderator
    - A material that slows down the neutrons (easier to be captured by nuclides)
        - Water, heavy water, graphite, carbon dioxide
            - Heavy water is the most effective moderator but is also the most expensive
            - Water is the cheapest but absorbs a lot of neutrons reducing the extent of the chain reaction

- Control Rods
    - A nuclear reactor can also produce great amounts of energy but the energy release must be controlled by restricting how many neutrons go on to be absorbed by a U-235 nucleus
    - Control rods are material that absorbs excess neutrons
        - Made of cadmium or boron steel
            - When a neutron strikes a control rod, it is absorbed into the nucleus of the material

Coolant

- The coolant is a liquid that run through pipes to absorb heat energy that has been produced from the core to keep it from overheating
    - Water, heavy water, carbon dioxide, liquid sodium

- Heat Exchanger
    - A heat exchanger transfers the heat created in the reactor into pipes containing water
        - This water is converted into high-pressure steam that is used to rotate the turbines that drive the generator

- Radiation Shield
    - The radiation shield protects workers and the surrounding environment from exposure to radiation leaks from the core of the reactor
        - Made of lead, concrete and graphite

#### Nuclear Waste Management

- Low Level Waste
    - Things that have been around radiation
    - Processed by burning
- Medium Level Waste
    - Things that have been around radiation for extended periods
    - Processed by solidifying in concrete/burying
- High Level Waste
    - Things that are literally radiating
    - Processed by coolant ponds or kept in secure storage
    - Must be stored permanently due to how long the half-lives are for the radioactive materials
## Pros and Cons of Nuclear Power
- Cons:
	- Nuclear Weapons proliferation
		- Nuclear energy is very closely connected to Nuclear Weaponry. The Nuclear Weapon Non-Proliferation act was meant to spread nuclear energy without spreading nuclear weaponry, but 5 countries have used this program to create their own nuclear weapons. It is hard to tell the difference between a nuclear power station, and a site to build nuclear weapons. The road to nuclear energy is paved by nuclear power plants
	- Nuclear waste and pollution
		- Nuclear waste takes tens of thousands of years to stop being radioactive. It is very dangerous, it can't be used, and it is incredibly hard to dispose of.
	- Accidents and disasters
		- Since the development of nuclear energy, there have been 7 major disasters. 3 of these were contained, but 4 were not. These have caused many deaths, and the areas in which these disasters happen are then uninhabitable.

- Pros:
	- Nuclear energy saves lives
		- Nuclear energy has saved 15000 lives since it was developed. A study by NASA finds that nuclear energy has the smallest death per unit of energy rate of any form of energy, even when taking into account the deaths due to nuclear meltdowns.
	- Nuclear energy reduces CO2 emmissions
		- Since the 1960, 64 Giga-tonnes of CO2 have not emitted because we are using nuclear energy instead of fossil fuels.
	- New technologies
		- New technologies may solve problems relating to nuclear energy. Nuclear reactor technology hasn’t improved since the 1970s.
