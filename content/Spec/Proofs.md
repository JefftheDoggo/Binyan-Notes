## What proofs are
Proofs can mean multiple things in different contexts, such as law, science, and mathematics.

Different contexts require different amounts of evidence as proof of truth.

3 statements:

In 1963 it was proved that a Perth man, John Button, murdered Rosemary Anderson. - Legal process

There was reasonable evidence that he did, an a jury decided that due to this evidence it was most likely that this happened.

The chemist Linus Pauling proved that large doses of Vitamin C are effective at preventing colds. - Scientific process

He made a hypothesis, and tried to prove it incorrect. Since he couldn't refute his hypothesis, it is considered proof that this is true.

The Pythagorean Order proved that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of a right-angles triangle equals the square of the longest side. - Mathematical process

It was proven that in every case, not just in a few, this is true in every case. This is done by proving the general case, such as a generic right triangle (no specific numbers, but only things considered for all right triangles, such as a hypotenuse, 3 sides, a right angle, etc).

Mathematics has a much higher standard of proof than other disciplines.
## Set Notation
N - the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,4,5…} - Positive integers

Z - the set of all integers {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5} - integers

Q  - the set of all ration numbers e.g. {2/3, -22/7, 1.86, 5}

R - the set of all real numbers (including all rational and irrational numbers)

N is in Z which is in Q which is in R

A curved E means 'is in' or 'belongs to'

Without the line, it is a strict subset (smaller than the full set)

## Conditional Statements
It states a condition (if) and tells you a consequence (then)

If a polygon Is a quadrilateral, then it has exactly four sides

If you were born in Australia, then you have been in Australia

If an even number is greater than 2, then the number is not prime

A $=>$ means A implies B or If A then B!

## Proving Conditional Statements
- When proving that If A then B: You are proving that a causal relationship exists between A and B
	1.  Assume that A is true, and then
	2.  Show that B must follow as a consequence
- E.g If n is divisble by 7, then n2 is divisible by 49:

	1.  Assume that n is divisible by 7
	2.  n = 7m for some integer m
	3.  n2 = 49m2
	4.  Since m2 is an integer, n2 is divisible by 49
	5.  QED (Quad erat demonstratum, meaning as it was demonstrated)

## Modifying Conditional Statements
For a true conditional statement If A then B

Converse (If B then A) - May or may not be true

Inverse (If not A then not B) - May or may not be true

Contrapositive (If not B then not A) - Is true
## Proof by Contradiction
Sometimes, a direct proof is impossible for a given conditional statement. In this case, we may assume that it is true, and  show that this would contradict some given fact.
- How to do a proof by contradiction
	1.  Assume that the statement we want to prove is false.
	2.  Show that this assumption leads to mathematical nonsense.
	3.  Conclude that we were wrong to assume that the statement is false.
	4.  Conclude that the statement must be true.

## Quantifiers
If and only if - Implication goes 2 ways
There exists - In at least 1 case
For all - In every case

- Symbols
	- Upside down A means "for all"
	- Backward E means "there exists"
