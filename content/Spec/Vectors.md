## Representations of Vectors
Vectors have both Magnitude and Direction
- Symbols:
	$\vec{AB}$ - A vector AB
	$\underset{\sim}{a}$ - A vector a
	$|\vec{AB}|$ - The magnitude of a vector AB
	â - A unit vector in the direction of vector a
	$\overline{AB}$ - A line AB
## Adding and Subtracting Vectors
- Adding
	- Use diagram (nose-tail) or add components
	- $\vec{AB}$ + $\vec{BC}$ = $\vec{AC}$
		- Adjacent identical letters cancel out
		- $\vec{AB}$+$\vec{BC}$+$\vec{CD}$+$\vec{DE}$+$\vec{EF}$=$\vec{AF}$
- Subtracting
	- Add a negative vector (same magnitude different direction)
		- $\vec{AB}$ + $\vec{BC}$ -$\vec{DC}$ = $\vec{AD}$ 
			- Rewrite the subtraction as adding a minus vector
			- $\vec{AB}$ + $\vec{BC}$ +$\vec{CD}$ = $\vec{AD}$ 

## Vector Components
i is horizontal, j is vertical
use sin (vertical) and cos (horizontal) to caluclate them using the angle and the magnitude
Adding the components is easier than usual vector addition and subtraction
It just makes calculations easier
Vectors in component form are equal if and only if their components are equal
-   ai + bj = ci + dj if and only if a = c and b = d
## Calculating the Magnitude and Direction
- Magnitude
	- |p| = magnitude of p
	- p = 6i + 3j
	- |p| = $\sqrt{6^2+3^2}$ 
Direction
- Unit vector is a vector 1 unit in a given direction
	- For a vector a the unit vector is:
		- â = $\frac{a}{|a|}$
## Extra stuff
-   Vectors are equal if they have same magnitude and direction
-   A vector with a negative sign has the same magnitude but opposite direction  (-$\vec{AB}$ = $\vec{BA}$)
-   A zero vector 0 has magnitude 0 and an undefined direction
-   Vectors are parallel if they can be represented as a = mb


## Position Vectors
The vector from the origin to a point (let's say A) is known as the position vector of A.
## Scalar (Dot) Product
The scalar product (also known as dot product) is an operation that takes two vectors and gives a real number
A.B = $A_yB_y$ + $A_xB_x$ 
	Alternative:
		a.b = |a||b|cos$\theta$
			Where $\theta$ is the angle between a and b
			You can find $\theta$ using this:
				$\cos\theta$ = $\frac{a.b}{|a||b|}$ = $\frac{a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2}{|a| |b|}$
Rules of Scalar products:
	If A or B = 0, A.B = 0
	a.b = b.a
	a.(b+c) = a.b+a.c
	$\lambda$(a.b) = a.($\lambda$b) = ($\lambda$a).b
	a.a = $|a|^2$ 
	a.b = |a||b| if a and b are parallel and in the same direction
	a.b = -|a||b| if a and b are parallel and in opposite directions
