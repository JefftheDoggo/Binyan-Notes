It is what it is my guy.

You got the gradient (m) which is rise/run.

You got the y-intercept (c) which is where the y-axis is intercepted.

Literally just use substitution and basic logic to solve problems.

This is literally the easiest year 11 math there is why the fuck do you need notes on it.
