## Finding the key points

- X-intercept
	- solve $ax^2+bx+c = 0$ 
- Y-intercept
	- $x = 0 , y = c$
- Turning point
	- X-coordinate
		- $x = \frac{-b}{2a}$
	- Y-coordinate
		- $y = \frac{4ac=b^2}{4a}$


## The Quadratic Formula and the discriminant
- The Quadratic Formula
	- $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
	- It's literally a formula just use it
- The discriminant
	- You can't take the root of a negative, so $\sqrt {b^2-4ac}$ must be positive or 0
		- If it is positive, it has 2 solutions
		- If it is 0, it has 1 solution
		- If it is negative, it has 0 solutions
