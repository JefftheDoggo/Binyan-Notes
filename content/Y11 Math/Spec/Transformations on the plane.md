## Linear transformations and Matrices

- A coordinate can be expressed as a $2 \times 1$ matrix $[{x \atop y}]$
- Transformations to these points can be represented with matrix multiplication, with a $2\times2$ matrix.
	- A $2\times 2$ matrix ($[{a \atop c}{b \atop d}]$) represents 2  transformations
## Reflection

A reflection across an axis can be represented with matrix multiplication:
- $[{-1 \atop 0}{0 \atop 1}][{x \atop y}]$ when you are reflecting across the y-axis
-  $[{1 \atop 0}{0 \atop -1}][{x \atop y}]$ when you are reflecting across the x-axis
- A more general case, reflecting over the line $y = mx$
	- $\theta$ is the angle between $y = mx$ and the positive direction of the x-axis.
	- m = $\tan \theta$ 
	- $y = \tan \theta  \times x$
	- the transformation matrix to reflect over $y = mx$ is $[{\cos 2\theta \atop \sin 2 \theta}{\sin 2 \theta \atop -\cos 2 \theta}]$
## Dilation

- Reflection is like a special case for dilation. 
- You can dilate across the x-axis, or across the y-axis
- A horizontal dilation parallel to the x-axis can be represented with the matrix transformation
	- $[{c \atop 0}{0 \atop 1}]$  where c is the scale factor
- A vertical dilation parallel to the y-axis can be represented with the matrix transformation
	- $[{1 \atop 0}{0 \atop c}]$  where c is the scale factor

## Translation
- Translation can be represented with addition of a matrix to a set of points.
-  $[{x \atop y}]+[{1 \atop 1}]$ represents a translation right 1 unit, and up one unit
- These matrices can be expanded to fit as many points as needed.

## Rotation

A rotation of  $\theta Ëš$ anticlockwise can be made by multiplying your matrix by $[{\cos \theta \atop \sin  \theta}{-\sin  \theta \atop \cos  \theta}]$
