##### Probability equations:

|Meaning|Equation|
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Probability of A|$P(A)$ = no. of favourable outcomes/total outcomes|
|Probability Range|$0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1$ **(0 is impossible, 1 is certain)**|
|Rule of Addition|$P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)$ **(can swap sides)**|
|Rule of Complementary Events|$P(A’) + P(A) = 1$|
|Mutually Exclusivity Test|$P(A∩B) = 0$|
|Independence Test|$P(A∩B) = P(A)\times P(B)$|
|Conditional Probability|$P(A|B)P(A)\times P(B)$|
|Bayes Formula|$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)}$|

##### Combinations

Where you are picking r objects from n objects:
$^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$

Where you are ordering r objects from n objects:
$^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

##### Set Notation

$\mathbb{N}$ - the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,4,5…} - Positive integers
$\mathbb{Z}$ - the set of all integers {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5} - integers
$\mathbb{Q}$  - the set of all ration numbers e.g. {2/3, -22/7, 1.86, 5}
$\mathbb{R}$ - the set of all real numbers (including all rational and irrational numbers)
$\mathbb{A}$ - the set of all algebraic numbers
$\mathbb{C}$ - the set of all complex numbers
$\mathbb{N}$ is in $\mathbb{Z}$ which is in $\mathbb{Q}$ which is in $\mathbb{R}$

$\varnothing$ is an empty set
$\in$ - is in 
$\notin$ - is not in
$\ni$ - has member
$\subset$ - is a proper (smaller) subset of
$\subseteq$ - is a subset of

$\cup$ - union
$\cap$ - intersection
