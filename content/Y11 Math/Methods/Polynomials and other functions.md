## What is a polynomial?

A polynomial is what it says on the tin (poly meaning many, nomial meaning names)
It is Â a function that can be written in the form P(x) = $ax^n+bx^{n-1}+cx^{n-2}...$

## Terminology and polynomials

- 0 is called the zero polynomial
- - The leading term of a polynomial is the term of highest index among those terms with a non-zero coefficient
- The degree of a polynomial is the value of n
- A monic polynomial is a polynomial whose leading term has coefficient 1
- The constant term is the term of index 0 (This is the term not involving x)

## Factorising polynomials
### Factorising Cubics
- A cubic polynomial can be represented like this: $x^3+(a-b)x^2-(ab-c)x-ac = 0$
- Find a
	- a is a factor of the last term
	- Find all factors of the last term
	- See if they are a factor of the whole polynomial
- Divide the polynomial by (x-a)
	- I know how to do polynomial long division but I can't be fucked explaining it to you because I'd have to format. Heres a video on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FSXJmESFmQ
### Other polynomials
- Repeat steps for a quadratic or cubic until you have something you can solve like a linear equation. You'll be fine, they probably aren't gonna give you anything more than a 4th degree polynomial anyways.

## Other functions

- Rectangular Hyperbolae
	- y=$\frac{1}{x}$
	- Show asymptotes
	- Don't ask why it's rectangular, it doesn't really look like it.
- The Sideways Quadratic
	- $y^2=x$
	- It's literally a quadratic but sideways
- Root function
	- $y=\sqrt{x}$
	- Hald of the sideways quadratic
- Circles
	- $(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$
	- Centre at (h,k)
	- radius of r
	- Complete the square to make into a usable equation
- Bigger and better polynomials
