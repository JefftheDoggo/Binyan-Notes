Probability equations:

|Meaning|Equation|
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Probability of A|$P(A)$ = no. of favourable outcomes/total outcomes|
|Probability Range|$0 ≤ P(A) ≤ 1$ **(0 is impossible, 1 is certain)**|
|Rule of Addition|$P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∩B)$ **(can swap sides)**|
|Rule of Complementary Events|$P(A’) + P(A) = 1$|
|Mutually Exclusivity Test|$P(A∩B) = 0$|
|Independence Test|$P(A∩B) = P(A)\times P(B)$|
|Conditional Probability|$P(A|B)P(A)\times P(B)$|
|Bayes Formula|$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)\times P(A)}{P(B)}$|
