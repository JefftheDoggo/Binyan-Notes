## Circle Proofs

This is just a list of axioms. Use them to try and prove shit ig

### Arcs/Segment Proofs
- Angle at the centre is the same as that at the circumference
- Angles in the same segment are equal
- Angles in a semicircle are 90˚
### Tangent Proofs
- A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a line drawn from the centre to the point of contact
- 2 tangents drawn from an external point have the same length
- The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to any angle in the alternate segment
### Chord/Secant Proofs
- If AB and CD are 2 chords of a circle, intersecting at P
	- $PA \times PB$ = $PC \times PD$ 
	- This still works if P is outside the circle
- If P is a point outside a circle and T, A, B are points on the circle such that PT is a tangent and PAB is a secant, then $|PT|^2 = |PA|{\times}|PB|$
### Cyclic Quadrilateral Proofs
- A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180° degrees
