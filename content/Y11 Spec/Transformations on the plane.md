## Linear transformations and Matrices

- A coordinate can be expressed as a $2 \times 1$ matrix $[{x \atop y}]$
- Transformations to these points can be represented with matrix multiplication, with a $2\times2$ matrix.
	- A $2\times 2$ matrix ($[{a \atop c}{b \atop d}]$) represents 2  transformations
## Reflection

A reflection across an axis can be represented with matrix multiplication:
- $[{-1 \atop 0}{0 \atop 1}][{x \atop y}]$ when you are reflecting across the y-axis
-  $[{1 \atop 0}{0 \atop -1}][{x \atop y}]$ when you are reflecting across the x-axis
