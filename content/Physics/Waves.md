## Types and Features of Waves
There are 2 types of wave, longitudinal, and transverse.

Longitudinal waves are like sound, with the periodic compressions and decompressions of the medium through which the wave is travelling. Transverse waves on the other hand, consist of the medium rising and falling, like a ripple in water.

The highest point of a transverse wave is called the crest, while the lowest is called the trough.

The most compressed and the most rarefacted part of a longitudinal wave are analogous to the crest and trough.

The amplitude of a wave is the distance from crest to trough, or the width of the wave if it is longitudinal.

The wavelength is the distance crest-crest, trough-trough, compression-compression, or rarefaction-rarefaction.

The frequency of a wave is how fast a wavelength moves past.
## Equations and the such
v - velocity 
f - frequency (wavelengths passing per second)
$\lambda$ - wavelength (length between points in phase)
T - period (time for one wavelength to pass)
I - intensity ($\frac{P}{r^2}$)
$v = f\lambda$ 
$T = \frac{1}{f}$
$I\propto\frac{1}{r^2}$
