## SUVAT Equations
s - displacement (distance from origin)
u - initial velocity (magnitiude + direction)
v - final velocity (magnitude + direction)
a - acceleration (change in velocity over time)
t - time taken

$v_{av} = \frac{s}{t}$
$a = \frac{v-u}{t}$
$v = u + at$
$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$
	This is proven by taking the area under a velocity-time graph, which gives the displacement.
$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$:
	$a = \frac{v-u}{t}$
	$\therefore t = \frac{v-u}{a}$
	$v_{av}\times t = s$
	$s = \frac{v-u}{a}\times \frac{u+v}{2}$
	$s = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2a}$
	$2as = v^2-u^2$
	$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$

## Laws of Motion
Newton's Laws of Motion:
	1.  A body at rest will stay at rest, and a body in motion will remain in motion, unless an external force is applied.
	2. Force is proportional to both the mass of the body and the acceleration of the body.
	3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
## Laws of Conservation
Matter must be conserved (Matter cannot be created or destroyed)
Energy must be conserved (Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only tranformed or transferred)
Momentum(p) must be conserved in a closed system (p = mv)
## Units and Definitions
Energy is the ability to do work (Measured in Joules)
Work is force applied to an object, causing displacement, or the change in energy ($W = Fs = \Delta E$, measured in Joules)
Power is the rate at which work is done ($P = W/t$)
Impulse is Force applied to an object over time ($I = Ft = \Delta p$)
Force is an action that maintains or alters the velocity of an object or distorts it. $F = ma$
Weight is not in kg, it is in N ($F = mg$)
Kinetic energy is movement energy ($E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$)
Gravitational potential energy is energy from height ($E_p = mg\Delta h$)
