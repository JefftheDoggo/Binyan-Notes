title: Accuracy, Precision, and Error
---

## Accuracy vs Precision
Accuracy - Closeness to actual value (not possible, as measuring changes the system)
Precision - Smallest unit of measurement of scale
Experimental precision - Closeness of values to each other
## Reliability
Reliability is the repeatability of results
## Error
Absolute error - Half of the smallest unit of scale

Percentage error - Au/Measurement *100%

When adding or subtracting measurements, add the absolute errors

When multiplying or dividing measurements, add the percentage errors
