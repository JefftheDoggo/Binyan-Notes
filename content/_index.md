Hello! I’m Binyan, this is my website of notes and other things I put in Obsidian. Thank you to [Bajay](https://baju-s.toomwn.xyz/) for being a massive help in setting this up!

I have a couple projects I'm working on. I do do reviews of some games and movies, I am working on making a conlang, and also I do some transcriptions of songs in my spare time. That being said, this site is mostly for my notes. Some of my notes are very good, and in other places I would recommend you look at my friend's website, [Baju's](https://baju-s.toomwn.xyz/). I'm not incredibly experienced with Obsidian and LaTeX, and also I'm not the best note-taker anyways, but I do what I can.

Don’t be afraid to ask for my help for anything (except English and French), I’m a good listener, and usually I teach things pretty well. Honestly it would be nice to teach something to someone else because it helps you articulate your ideas. I'd recommend using that strategy for studying too.

Here are some other good notes pages (I'm not in the town yet but they are good sites):

Big thank you to Jacky Zhao the creator of Quartz in which this website runs off. I don’t know how it works, but it does.
