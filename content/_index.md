Hello! I’m [[Other/About me|Binyan]], this is my website of notes from Obsidian, which Bajay suggested I make. Thank you Bajay. If something seems off in this website, it was probably Bajay or Edward who did it. Thank you to [Bajay](https://baju-s.toomwn.xyz/) and [Edward](https://github.com/eddietheed) for being a massive help in setting this up!

Some of this is still under construction, especially some sections of the French and Engineering parts, but they'll be up as soon as I finish transferring all my notes to obsidian.

Originally my notes were on OneNote and some are still there. However, everything important is here. If you need anything else it's probably simple enough to honestly not need my amazing notes.

Don’t be afraid to ask for my help for anything (except English and French), I’m a good listener, and usually I teach things pretty well. Honestly it would be nice to teach something to someone else because it helps you articulate your ideas. I'd recommend using that strategy for studying too.

Big thank you to Jacky Zhao the creator of Quartz in which this website runs off. I don’t know how it works, but it does.
