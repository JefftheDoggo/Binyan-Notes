4/5

In my opinion, these were the best flash games. They are incredibly addicting, though they are very simplistic. Freezeria is the best one objectively, but I enjoy Bakeria, Burgeria, and Wingeria more. The fact that they managed to franchise this game so many times has to say something about how popular they are, especially among school students.
