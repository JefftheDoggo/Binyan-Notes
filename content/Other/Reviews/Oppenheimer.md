4/5

I believe that Oppenheimer could easily be the best film of this year. I think that the sex scenes were less than necessary in some places, though some were done appropriately and in consideration for their place in the story. The sound design was magnificent, and I personally think that it is a strong contender for the best sound design of this year (opposed only by Across the Spiderverse). I loved the scene where the bomb exploded, very realistic, and I wasn't at all surprised that it was practical. 

The acting was phenomenal. Cillian Murphy's classic stoic style really embodied the post WWII personality of Oppenheimer, though in some places it did seem anachronistic, as even before the bomb was conceived he acts in this way, though the real Oppenheimer only really became this classicised character after the weight of the consequences of the Manhattan Project hit him, though he apparently always seemed deep in thought as he tried to gain insight on not just physics but also politics.

Overall it was an amazing movie, and I have very few criticisms of it.
