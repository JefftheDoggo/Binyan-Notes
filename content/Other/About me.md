My name is Ajay Bisnath, I think writing stuff on the internet about yourself is unnecessary but my best friend did it and now I feel obliged.

I’m guessing you are checking this page because you’re exploring my website and know me already or maybe you actually don’t know who I am. So I probably should provide some information for those in group 2.

I’m a Year 11 student who makes notes, is better than Baju and does a lot of other things. I’m a studious and competitive person who understands sarcasm and has to put up with the biggest rascal (Bajay). Also I am clearly better at Obsidian than Bajay.
