## Scene Analysis: Exposition

- Often, low angle shots are used in film to make the subject seem more powerful, but here they can have a different effect. Pay attention to where the camera is physically placed in the opening scenes (does it ever give the audience an interesting or unconventional vantage point of Truman?), and the use of a 'fisheye' lens in certain shots, analysing the overall effect on the audience.
	- In the opening scenes of the Truman show, many awkward camera angles and a 'fisheye' lens are used show that Truman is being watched without his knowledge. These camera angles reinforce the verisimilitude of the show to the audience, to the delight of the in movie audience, and to the horror of the audience in our world. When the light fell from the roof of the dome, Truman is portrayed from a low camera angle to show him as the subject of this show, the only thing of importance, while simultaneously being ironic since Truman is truly powerless.
