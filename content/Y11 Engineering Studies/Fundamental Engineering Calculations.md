Volume and Surface Area

Honestly if you need help to learn this you may need some extra help.

##### Tips
1. I would recommend practicing it, even though it seems very simple, because the shapes they give you are pretty weird.
2. Make sure you account for all faces when calculating surface area, and you aren't counting any twice. If in doubt, do each face separately rather than grouping, though grouping is much faster.

##### Density

Density is the measure of mass per volume, measured $kg\ \ m^-3$, though it is quite common to use $g\ \ cm^3$ for smaller objects. 

To use density in calculations, set it up as so:
- density (d) = $\frac{m}{V}$
- $m = dV$
- $V = \frac{m}{d}$
