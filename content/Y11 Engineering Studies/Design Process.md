## Investigating

- Develop comprehensive design brief
	- Identify and assess existing solutions or similar products using a variety of research skills
	- Research and critique materials and components relevant to the design brief
	- Consider different and appropriate sources of energy.

## Devising

- Produce annotated pictorial drawings of design ideas
	- Analyse and justify the choice of option to be used as the solution.

- Produce annotated orthographic drawings of design ideas

## Producing

- Present specifications for the selected solution:
	- dimensioned pictorial and orthographic drawings
	- orthographic drawings and sketches
	- 3rd angle projections
	- lines (outlines, hidden detail and centrelines)
	- dimensioning (linear, radii, circles and holes)
	- materials selection
	- parts lists
	- costing of prototype or working model

- Develop and use timeline for construction and testing of solution

- Construct solutions by selecting and using appropriate tools and machines and by following safe work practices

- Test the solution for correct function and document using checklists and test data.

## Evaluating

- Evaluate the final solution in terms of:
	- meeting the requirements of the design brief
	- safety, function and finish of product
	- modifications and changes to the design and processes during production
	- refinements and changes for future development.
