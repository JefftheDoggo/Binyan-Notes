Congrats! You are an engineering student. Good luck juggling theory and practical components. Mr O'Brien will help you.

Most of this is going to be on the theory, and the theory isn't too heavy, so even if you aren't an engineering student you should be able to get it.

Except electricity

Electricity has no theory

It's literally just magic

It works for no reason at all

It's so scuffed
