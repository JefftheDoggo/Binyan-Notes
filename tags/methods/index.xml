You got the gradient (m) which is rise/run.
You got the y-intercept (c) which is where the y-axis is intercepted.</description></item><item><title>Polynomials and other functions</title><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Methods/Polynomials-and-other-functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Methods/Polynomials-and-other-functions/</guid><description>What is a polynomial?
