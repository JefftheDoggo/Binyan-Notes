I think that the sex scenes were less than necessary in some places, though some were done appropriately and in consideration for their place in the story.</description></item><item><title>{{title}}</title><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Papas-Games-coolmathgames/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Papas-Games-coolmathgames/</guid><description>4/5
