Use them to try and prove shit ig
Arcs/Segment Proofs Angle at the centre is the same as that at the circumference Angles in the same segment are equal Angles in a semicircle are 90˚ Tangent Proofs A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to a line drawn from the centre to the point of contact 2 tangents drawn from an external point have the same length The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to any angle in the alternate segment Chord/Secant Proofs If AB and CD are 2 chords of a circle, intersecting at P $PA \times PB$ = $PC \times PD$ This still works if P is outside the circle If P is a point outside a circle and T, A, B are points on the circle such that PT is a tangent and PAB is a secant, then $|PT|^2 = |PA|{\times}|PB|$ Cyclic Quadrilateral Proofs A quadrilateral is cyclic if and only if the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180° degrees</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Matrices/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Matrices/</guid><description>Matrix Rules A matrix is a table except it&amp;rsquo;s mathed</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Transformations-on-the-plane/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Transformations-on-the-plane/</guid><description>Linear transformations and Matrices A coordinate can be expressed as a $2 \times 1$ matrix $[{x \atop y}]$ Transformations to these points can be represented with matrix multiplication, with a $2\times2$ matrix.</description></item><item><title>Proofs</title><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Proofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Math/Spec/Proofs/</guid><description>What proofs are Proofs can mean multiple things in different contexts, such as law, science, and mathematics.
