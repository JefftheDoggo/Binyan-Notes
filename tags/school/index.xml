You are an engineering student. Good luck juggling theory and practical components. Mr O&amp;rsquo;Brien will help you.
Most of this is going to be on the theory, and the theory isn&amp;rsquo;t too heavy, so even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t an engineering student you should be able to get it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Fundamental-Engineering-Calculations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Fundamental-Engineering-Calculations/</guid><description>Volume and Surface Area
