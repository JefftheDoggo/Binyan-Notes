I believe that Oppenheimer could easily be the best film of this year. I think that the sex scenes were less than necessary in some places, though some were done appropriately and in consideration for their place in the story.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Papas-Games-coolmathgames/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Papas-Games-coolmathgames/</guid><description>4/5
In my opinion, these were the best flash games. They are incredibly addicting, though they are very simplistic. Freezeria is the best one objectively, but I enjoy Bakeria, Burgeria, and Wingeria more.</description></item><item><title>Game Review</title><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Reviews/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Other/Reviews/Reviews/</guid><description> [[Papas Games @coolmathgames|Papas Games]] [[Oppenheimer]]</description></item></channel></rss>
