I do do reviews of some games and movies, I am working on making a conlang, and also I do some transcriptions of songs in my spare time. That being said, this site is mostly for my notes. Some of my notes are very good, and in other places I would recommend you look at my friend's website, [Baju's](https://baju-s.toomwn.xyz/).

I think that the sex scenes were less than necessary in some places, though some were done appropriately and in consideration for their place in the story. The sound design was magnificent, and I personally think that it is a strong contender for the best sound design of this year (opposed only by Across the Spiderverse). I loved the scene where the bomb exploded, very realistic, and I wasn't at all surprised that it was practical. \n\nThe acting was phenomenal. Cillian Murphy's classic stoic style really embodied the post WWII personality of Oppenheimer, though in some places it did seem anachronistic, as even before the bomb was conceived he acts in this way, though the real Oppenheimer only really became this classicised character after the weight of the consequences of the Manhattan Project hit him, though he apparently always seemed deep in thought as he tried to gain insight on not just physics but also politics.\n\nOverall it was an amazing movie, and I have very few criticisms of it.","lastmodified":"2023-09-16T03:37:40.996483801Z","tags":[]},"/Other/Reviews/Papas-Games-coolmathgames":{"title":"Papas Games @coolmathgames","content":"4/5\n\nIn my opinion, these were the best flash games.

Pay attention to where the camera is physically placed in the opening scenes (does it ever give the audience an interesting or unconventional vantage point of Truman?), and the use of a 'fisheye' lens in certain shots, analysing the overall effect on the audience.\n\t- In the opening scenes of the Truman show, many awkward camera angles and a 'fisheye' lens are used show that Truman is being watched without his knowledge. These camera angles reinforce the verisimilitude of the show to the audience, to the delight of the in movie audience, and to the horror of the audience in our world. When the light fell from the roof of the dome, Truman is portrayed from a low camera angle to show him as the subject of this show, the only thing of importance, while simultaneously being ironic since Truman is truly powerless.","lastmodified":"2023-09-16T03:37:40.996483801Z","tags":["school","year_11","english","finished"]},"/Y11-English/Unpolished-Gem":{"title":"Unpolished Gem","content":"## Quotes + Analysis\n\n- \"It is early morning, and their grins are so wide that it seems they all went to bed with clothes-hangers shoved in their mouths…\" (p. 7 - see also descriptions on ensuing pages, and the allusion to Alice in Wonderland on page 16)\n\t- Immigrants have optimistic expectations of Australia.

The gamma camera detects the energy from a radiotracer in your body and converts it into an image, it has radiation detectors called gamma camera heads.  A radiotracer is a radioactive tracer made from a  chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope. The gamma camera itself does not emit any radiation, only detects gamma radiation from the tracer\n\nPositron emission tomography (PET) scans are a medical imaging procedure that provides unique information about how an organ or system in the body is working. PET scans are mainly used to assess cancers, neurological (brain) diseases and cardiovascular (heart-related) disease. It works by detecting where sugar is being used in the body. The sugar is injected into the body with some radioisotopes in it, and tracked through the body by detecting the radiation. Malignant tissues generally use more glucose, so this can be used to detect these tissues.\n\n![Physics revision | GCSE and A Level Physics Revision | Cyberphysics, the  revision website](file:////Users/abhigyan/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image001.gif)\n\n_Figure 1. A gamma camera_\n\n## Use of Radioisotopes in Therapeutic Treatments\n\nRadioisotopes can be used to kill cancer cells. As the radioisotope begins to decay, it affects the targeted tissue or tumour because cancerous cells absorb more of the radioisotope than noncancerous cells do. The higher dose of radiation eventually destroys the cancer cells, but leaves the normal cells relatively intact.\n\nOne method of doing this is using the gamma knife. Gamma knife (fig.2) uses very precise beams of gamma rays to treat areas of disease. The very intense radiation makes it possible to treat internal issues without an incision, but radiosurgery is very risky can prevent cell growth.\n\n![Gamma Knife® stereotactic radiosurgery | Great Ormond Street Hospital](file:////Users/abhigyan/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg)\n\n_Figure 2. A gamma knife_\n\n## Production of Radioisotopes for Medicine\n\nMedical radioisotopes are made from materials bombarded by neutrons in a reactor, or by protons in an accelerator called a cyclotron (fig.3), which uses electromagnets to accelerate particles to very high speeds. Different radioisotopes are used for different medical procedures, as they each have different properties depending on the mass, stability, and type of radiation.\n\nThe most commonly used radioisotope in medicine is technetium-99m, which is produced from uranium silicide which has been processed into molybdenum-99, which then undergoes beta decay to become technetium-99m.\n\nTechnetium-99m’s short half-life (6 hours) and weak gamma ray emission makes it ideal for imagin the body to detect disease, without causing too much damage to the body tissue.\n\n![Cyclotron - W3schools](file:////Users/abhigyan/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image003.jpg)\n\n_Figure 3. A cylotron_\n\n## Proton Therapy\n\nProton therapy is a radiation treatment that uses beams of protons to destroy tumours. The properties of protons (their positive charge) make them effective at targeting tumours of different sizes and shapes.\n\nAs protons move through the body, they attract electrons, which have a negative charge. The proton travels at very high speeds at first (around 2/3 of the speed of light), so it has very little interactions, and very little radioactive activity at first. As it progress through the body, the proton slows down and interacts with many more electrons, causing much more radioactive activity. This point is known as the Bragg Peak (Fig.4).\n\nBy changing the energy of the proton when it is launched, we can change the depth the protons slow down at and where most of the radiation is released. Because the most interactions are at this point, proton therapy can accurately target specific areas of the body and not healthy tissues.\n\n![](file:////Users/abhigyan/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.png)\n\n_Figure 4. The Bragg Peak_\n\n## Fast Neutron Therapy\n\nFast neutron therapy is used for specific diseases that are “radioresistant”, i.e. they are not easily removed by conventions forms of radiotherapy. Fast neutrons are variably reactive with different tissues, affecting cancerous tissue more than healthy tissue. This means a lethal dose for the diseased cells is not a lethal dose for other cells, meaning it can be used to treat disease.\n\n![[Pasted image 20230627140031.png]]\nFigure 5. A room used for neutron therapy\n\n## Radiation Dosimetry\n\nRadiation dosimetry is the science by which radiation dose is determined by calculation or measurement. Radiation dosimetry is important, as different medical procedures require different levels of dosages of radiation, just like other medicines.\n\n Radiation Dose, or Absorbed Dose is the amount of radiation deposited in a tissue, divided by the mass of the tissue, and is measured in Grays (Gy). This measure is not the best way to measure radiation dose, as both the type of tissue and type of radiation will change the effect of the same radiation deposited.\n\nTo account for this, Dose Equivalent is used. It is calculated by the absorbed dose multiplied by the quality factor of a specific type of radiation (Fig.6). Dose Equivalent is measure in Sieverts (Sv).\n\n|   |   |\n|------------|-----------|\n|Radiation|Quality Factor|\n|α particles|20|\n|Neutrons|10|\n|β particles|1|\n|γ rays|1|\n|X-rays|1|\n\n_Figure 6.

The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life.\n\nUse logic to do the math it's not too hard.\n## Fission, Fusion, and Mass Defect\nMass defect is the difference between the actual mass of the nucleus and the predicted mass calculated by adding the mass of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.\n\nThis difference is because of the mass of the binding energy in the nucleus. Without the binding energy, the nucleus would not be stable, and would fall apart.\n\nFor an atom to be stable, it's mass must be less than that of its constituents.\n\nE=mc2 is the relationship between the mass defect (m) and the amount of energy that it represents, by the factor of the speed of light squared.\n\nNuclei with a large binding energy per nucleon are most stable. Smaller nuclei will undergo fusion (2 become 1) to become more stable. Larger nuclei will undergo fission (1 become 2) to become more stable.\n## Nuclear Power Stations\n\n#### Fuel\n- U-235 is fissile and is used. We used Uranium with 4% U-235 since enriching the fuel is difficult and expensive\n- U-238 is not fissile, but is fertile as it can transmutate into Pu-239 which is fissile when it absorbs a fast neutron, which is produced by the fission of U-235.\n- Pu-239 is produced from U-238 absorbing a neutron and produced a similar amount of energy to U-235 when is undergoes fission.\n\n#### Issues with making nuclear power:\n- Neutrons emitted by uranium-235 (fuel) are very fast but uranium-235 is most fissile when irradiated by **slow-moving neutrons**\n    - The emitted neutrons need to be slowed down to continue an efficient chain reaction\n- Uranium-235 fission emits an average of 2.47 neutrons which need to be controlled as **it could cause an explosion**\n- The heat generated in the reactor from the fission needs to be collected for electricity generation\n- Most Uranium is U-238, which is not fissile. For Uranium to be usable as a fuel, it needs to be enriched with U-235. This can be done using their slightly differing masses, but is very difficult and expensive.\n\n#### Components of Nuclear Power Stations\n\n- Fuel Rods\n\t- Fuel rods are long, thin rods the contain pellets of enriched uranium\n\t- Fuel rods use uranium with 4% uranium-235\n\t\t- The enriched uranium (in pellet form) is packed into a thin aluminium tube 3-5 metres long\n\t- A large nuclear reactor has over 1000 fuel rods in its core\n\t\t- Fuel rods need to be replaced around every 4 years\n\n- Moderator\n    - A material that slows down the neutrons (easier to be captured by nuclides)\n        - Water, heavy water, graphite, carbon dioxide\n            - Heavy water is the most effective moderator but is also the most expensive\n            - Water is the cheapest but absorbs a lot of neutrons reducing the extent of the chain reaction\n\n- Control Rods\n    - A nuclear reactor can also produce great amounts of energy but the energy release must be controlled by restricting how many neutrons go on to be absorbed by a U-235 nucleus\n    - Control rods are material that absorbs excess neutrons\n        - Made of cadmium or boron steel\n            - When a neutron strikes a control rod, it is absorbed into the nucleus of the material\n\nCoolant\n\n- The coolant is a liquid that run through pipes to absorb heat energy that has been produced from the core to keep it from overheating\n    - Water, heavy water, carbon dioxide, liquid sodium\n\n- Heat Exchanger\n    - A heat exchanger transfers the heat created in the reactor into pipes containing water\n        - This water is converted into high-pressure steam that is used to rotate the turbines that drive the generator\n\n- Radiation Shield\n    - The radiation shield protects workers and the surrounding environment from exposure to radiation leaks from the core of the reactor\n        - Made of lead, concrete and graphite\n\n#### Nuclear Waste Management\n\n- Low Level Waste\n    - Things that have been around radiation\n    - Processed by burning\n- Medium Level Waste\n    - Things that have been around radiation for extended periods\n    - Processed by solidifying in concrete/burying\n- High Level Waste\n    - Things that are literally radiating\n    - Processed by coolant ponds or kept in secure storage\n    - Must be stored permanently due to how long the half-lives are for the radioactive materials\n## Pros and Cons of Nuclear Power\n- Cons:\n\t- Nuclear Weapons proliferation\n\t\t- Nuclear energy is very closely connected to Nuclear Weaponry. The Nuclear Weapon Non-Proliferation act was meant to spread nuclear energy without spreading nuclear weaponry, but 5 countries have used this program to create their own nuclear weapons. It is hard to tell the difference between a nuclear power station, and a site to build nuclear weapons. The road to nuclear energy is paved by nuclear power plants\n\t- Nuclear waste and pollution\n\t\t- Nuclear waste takes tens of thousands of years to stop being radioactive. It is very dangerous, it can't be used, and it is incredibly hard to dispose of.\n\t- Accidents and disasters\n\t\t- Since the development of nuclear energy, there have been 7 major disasters. 3 of these were contained, but 4 were not. These have caused many deaths, and the areas in which these disasters happen are then uninhabitable.\n\n- Pros:\n\t- Nuclear energy saves lives\n\t\t- Nuclear energy has saved 15000 lives since it was developed. A study by NASA finds that nuclear energy has the smallest death per unit of energy rate of any form of energy, even when taking into account the deaths due to nuclear meltdowns.\n\t- Nuclear energy reduces CO2 emmissions\n\t\t- Since the 1960, 64 Giga-tonnes of CO2 have not emitted because we are using nuclear energy instead of fossil fuels.\n\t- New technologies\n\t\t- New technologies may solve problems relating to nuclear energy. Nuclear reactor technology hasn’t improved since the 1970s.","lastmodified":"2023-09-16T03:37:41.000483852Z","tags":["year_11","school","finished","physics"]},"/Y11-Physics/Specific-Heat-Capacity-of-a-Metal-Validation":{"title":"Specific Heat Capacity
