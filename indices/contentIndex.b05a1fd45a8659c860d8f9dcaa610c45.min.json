However, everything important is here. If you need anything else it's probably simple enough to honestly not need my amazing notes.\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask for my help for anything (except English and French), I’m a good listener, teacher and a Bajay copier.\n\nBig thank you to Jacky Zhao the creator of Quartz in which this website runs off. I don’t know how it works, but it does.","lastmodified":"2023-06-27T04:05:10.122581783Z","tags":[]},"/Other/About-me":{"title":"About me","content":"My name is Binyan, I think writing stuff on the internet about yourself is unnecessary but my best friend did it and now I feel obliged.\n\nI’m guessing you are checking this page because you’re exploring my website and know me already or maybe you actually don’t know who I am. So I probably should provide some information for those in group 2.\n\nI’m a Year 11 student who makes notes, is better than Baju and does a lot of other things.

Refer to the types of radiation to figure out what type happened.\n## Properties of Radiation\n## Half-Life\nWhen a radioactive element decays, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases with time. The time it takes for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease to half its original amount is called its half-life.\n\nUse logic to do the math it's not too hard.\n## Fission, Fusion, and Mass Defect\nMass defect is the difference between the actual mass of the nucleus and the predicted mass calculated by adding the mass of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus.\n\nThis difference is because of the mass of the binding energy in the nucleus. Without the binding energy, the nucleus would not be stable, and would fall apart.\n\nFor an atom to be stable, it's mass must be less than that of its constituents.\n\nE=mc2 is the relationship between the mass defect (m) and the amount of energy that it represents, by the factor of the speed of light squared.\n\nNuclei with a large binding energy per nucleon are most stable. Smaller nuclei will undergo fusion (2 become 1) to become more stable. Larger nuclei will undergo fission (1 become 2) to become more stable.\n## Pros and Cons of Nuclear Power\n- Cons:\n\t- Nuclear Weapons proliferation\n\t\t- Nuclear energy is very closely connected to Nuclear Weaponry. The Nuclear Weapon Non-Proliferation act was meant to spread nuclear energy without spreading nuclear weaponry, but 5 countries have used this program to create their own nuclear weapons. It is hard to tell the difference between a nuclear power station, and a site to build nuclear weapons. The road to nuclear energy is paved by nuclear power plants\n\t- Nuclear waste and pollution\n\t\t- Nuclear waste takes tens of thousands of years to stop being radioactive. It is very dangerous, it can't be used, and it is incredibly hard to dispose of.\n\t- Accidents and disasters\n\t\t- Since the development of nuclear energy, there have been 7 major disasters. 3 of these were contained, but 4 were not. These have caused many deaths, and the areas in which these disasters happen are then uninhabitable.\n\n- Pros:\n\t- Nuclear energy saves lives\n\t\t- Nuclear energy has saved 15000 lives since it was developed. A study by NASA finds that nuclear energy has the smallest death per unit of energy rate of any form of energy, even when taking into account the deaths due to nuclear meltdowns.\n\t- Nuclear energy reduces CO2 emmissions\n\t\t- Since the 1960, 64 Giga-tonnes of CO2 have not emitted because we are using nuclear energy instead of fossil fuels.\n\t- New technologies\n\t\t- New technologies may solve problems relating to nuclear energy. Nuclear reactor technology hasn’t improved since the 1970s.","lastmodified":"2023-06-27T04:05:10.122581783Z","tags":[]},"/Y11-Physics/Vectors":{"title":"Vectors","content":"\n## Vectors\nVectors have magnitude and direction, scalars just have magnitude\n\nCommon vectors and scalars\n| Vector             | Symbol  | Unit    | Scalar         | Symbol  | Unit  |\n| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | -------------- | ------- | ----- |\n| Displacement | s | m   | distance | s | m |\n| Velocity           | v       | m/s     | Speed          | v       | m/s   |\n| Acceleration       | a       | $m/s^2$ | temperature    | T       | ˚C\\˚K |\n| Force              | F       | N       | Time           | t       | s     |\n| Jerk                   |   j      |   $m/s^3$      |     Work           |    W     |   J    |\n## Vector Diagrams\nDemonstrate all similar vectors in the system\nHead-tail\n\tResolved\nEither draw a compass or refer to the direction\n## Free Body Diagram\nRefer to all the FORCES acting on the body\n\tName 'special' forces (e.g. Gravity)\n\tTo scale\n\tNot resolved","lastmodified":"2023-06-27T04:05:10.122581783Z","tags":[]},"/Y11-Physics/Waves":{"title":"Waves","content":"\n## Types and Features of Waves\nThere are 2 types of wave, longitudinal, and transverse.\n\nLongitudinal waves are like sound, with the periodic compressions and decompressions of the medium through which the wave is travelling.

This is done by proving the general case, such as a generic right triangle (no specific numbers, but only things considered for all right triangles, such as a hypotenuse, 3 sides, a right angle, etc).\n\nMathematics has a much higher standard of proof than other disciplines.\n## Set Notation\nN - the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,4,5…} - Positive integers\n\nZ - the set of all integers {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5} - integers\n\nQ  - the set of all ration numbers e.g. {2/3, -22/7, 1.86, 5}\n\nR - the set of all real numbers (including all rational and irrational numbers)\n\nN is in Z which is in Q which is in R\n\nA curved E means 'is in' or 'belongs to'\n\n - subset symbol![](data:image/png;base64,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)\n\nWithout the line, it is a strict subset (smaller than the full set)\n\n## Conditional Statements\nIt states a condition (if) and tells you a consequence (then)\n\nIf a polygon Is a quadrilateral, then it has exactly four sides\n\nIf you were born in Australia, then you have been in Australia\n\nIf an even number is greater than 2, then the number is not prime\n\nA $=\u003e$ means A implies B or If A then B!\n\n## Proving Conditional Statements\n- When proving that If A then B: You are proving that a causal relationship exists between A and B\n\t1.
