Since he couldn't refute his hypothesis, it is considered proof that this is true.\n\nThe Pythagorean Order proved that the sum of the squares of the shorter sides of a right-angles triangle equals the square of the longest side. - Mathematical process\n\nIt was proven that in every case, not just in a few, this is true in every case. This is done by proving the general case, such as a generic right triangle (no specific numbers, but only things considered for all right triangles, such as a hypotenuse, 3 sides, a right angle, etc).\n\nMathematics has a much higher standard of proof than other disciplines.\n## Set Notation\nN - the set of natural numbers {1,2,3,4,5‚Ä¶} - Positive integers\n\nZ - the set of all integers {-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5} - integers\n\nQ¬† - the set of all ration numbers e.g. {2/3, -22/7, 1.86, 5}\n\nR - the set of all real numbers (including all rational and irrational numbers)\n\nN is in Z which is in Q which is in R\n\nA curved E means 'is in' or 'belongs to'\n\n¬†- subset symbol![](data:image/png;base64,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)\n\nWithout the line, it is a strict subset (smaller than the full set)\n\n## Conditional Statements\nIt states a condition (if) and tells you a consequence (then)\n\nIf a polygon Is a quadrilateral, then it has exactly four sides\n\nIf you were born in Australia, then you have been in Australia\n\nIf an even number is greater than 2, then the number is not prime\n\nA $=\u003e$¬†means A implies B or If A then B!\n\n## Proving Conditional Statements\n- When proving that If A then B: You are proving that a causal relationship exists between A and B\n\t1.
