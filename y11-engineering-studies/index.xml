You are an engineering student. Good luck juggling theory and practical components. Mr O&amp;rsquo;Brien will help you.
Most of this is going to be on the theory, and the theory isn&amp;rsquo;t too heavy, so even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t an engineering student you should be able to get it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Fundamental-Engineering-Calculations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Fundamental-Engineering-Calculations/</guid><description>Volume, Surface Area, Density.
Honestly if you need help to learn this you may need some extra help.
I would recommend practicing it though, because the shapes they give you are pretty weird.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Materials/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Materials/</guid><description>Under construction</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Systems-and-Control/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Systems-and-Control/</guid><description>Under construction</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Y11-Engineering-Studies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jeffthedoggo.github.io/Binyan-Notes/Y11-Engineering-Studies/Y11-Engineering-Studies/</guid><description>Look, I&amp;rsquo;ll add more soon
